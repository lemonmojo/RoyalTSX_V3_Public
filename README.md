# Royal TSX V3 Public Source Code

### What's included
Right now, only the native code portion of the [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2) plugin is included in this repository. Changes from the original code by [gnachman](https://github.com/gnachman) are annotated with `LMiTerm Edit`. The project includes two additional targets:
* **LMiTerm**: This builds a Cocoa framework that includes everything necessary to create iTerm terminal instances and embed them in `NSView`s.
* **FXiTermTestApp**: This builds a Cocoa application that showcases the functionality in the LMiTerm.framework.
